Safe torrenting software, such as such as µTorrent Classic, are needed to send or receive files using the protocol. With over 100 million active torrent programs installed on home computers across the world, the protocol enables efficient distribution of files from many recipients to many downloaders. Any file being distributed is segmented into many pieces that eventually make up the complete file. After the process has concluded, those same pieces can be seeded to become a source for other downloaders. In this way, the protocol serves as a decentralized ecosystem, made up of millions of active torrent clients.":"<b>µTorrent is a peer-to-peer communications protocol</b> for efficiently sending any type of file, large or small, over the Internet.
